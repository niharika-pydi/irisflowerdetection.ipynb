# irisflowerdetection.ipynb
The `irisflowerdetection.ipynb` notebook is a machine learning project designed to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset, available in Scikit-Learn, consists of 150 samples (50 per class). The project begins with data preprocessing, which includes loading the dataset, checking for missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using scatter plots and histograms. The dataset is then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to ensure effective model evaluation. Several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are trained using the training set. The models are evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and precision-recall-F1 scores to determine the best-performing classifier. The final model can then be used to predict new iris species based on given feature inputs. Additionally, it can be saved using `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment in real-world applications. This notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, making it an excellent example of classification tasks in machine learning.
